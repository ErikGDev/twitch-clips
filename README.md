Download top clips from twitch.tv. Change arguments for game, limit, language etc. inside api.py. To download and concatenate the files, run concatenate.py. The python program imports from api.py, therefore it will run everything and output a concatenated .mp4 file. The youtube.py file currently uses command line arguments to upload the mp4 as a youtube video.
